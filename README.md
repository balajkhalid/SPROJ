# SPROJ: Disaster Response System

Acknowledgement: We are deeply thankful to our mentor and project superviser Dr Suleman Shahid for giving us his time and quality advice; without his support and belief, this SPROJ would not be possible.

This is a repository for our Senior Project "Disaster Response System". Disaster Response System is a customisable, swiftly deployable framework that can generate multiple instances operating for various crises. This framework constitutes a WordPress Website, a crowdsourcing platform, RASA powered chatbot and a Python powered machine learning algorithm. The chatbot can instantly answer common questions and provide general information about the disaster such as safety instructions, emergency contacts, etc. The ML algorithm provides “True” or “False” verification on input information to identify misinformation for a layman user. The crowdsourcing platform will allow users to submit their queries and get answers from the general public. The WordPress website provides live, updated information about the disaster and links all the components of the framework together. Our first instance for the system is based on the on-going pandemic SARS-COVID-19.
